## Minimum Spanning Tree - Kruskal's Algorithm

Write a program to calculate minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm. The graph below is from the Minimum Spanning Tree lecture. For vertices, you can use numbers instead of letters. Keep the edge weights the same, the result of your program should be 38.

### Graph

```
Vertices: A, B, C, D, E, F, G <=> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
```


## Sample Output

```
Finding MST using Kruskal's Algorithm
Edges of MST are
1 - 6 =  5
1 - 2 =  6
2 - 7 =  7
3 - 7 =  5
5 - 7 =  7
4 - 5 =  8

Weight of MST is 38
```
